Stroiders will be a mining/management game similar in structure to Dwarf Fortress, but designed around space mining.

Elements to consider:
Gravity
Vacuum
Hazards
Materials

The game is currently written with Python3 in mind for the engine, and Blender3D in mind for the graphics.

Debate about the camera orientation gladly accepted.
