Stroiders will be a mining/management game similar in structure to Dwarf Fortress, but designed around space mining.

Elements to consider:
Gravity
Vacuum
Hazards
Materials

Currently writing the program in Python3. Plans to add the layer of pygame and the graphic element next. 2D top down seems like it might be the best idea early on.
